# About: 
# I chose Crystal as the second project language file for this project (Meadows/Network Troubleshooter) as I wanted to improve software diversity in Meadows, and also increase speed and readability. Crystal claims to be a mix of all the good of C (readability) and all the good of Ruby (speed). It is going to be used in many places where C can be alternated from here. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
